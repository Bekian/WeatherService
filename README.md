# WeatherService

This Weather Service is intended to be a service that runs in the background.
It takes weather data from set coordinates and saves it to a database every day.
The idea for the project is for practice building processes that run in the background autonomously or one that is managed by another task manager process.


#### Todo
- [X] update the sql table to only accept the first value from the request, if we wanted to use the arrays of data we'd use another table.
